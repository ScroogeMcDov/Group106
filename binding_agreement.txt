Names | Roles: 

 Dov Sherman | Director of End-User Relations 
 Lei Dai     | Head of Conceptual Level Design

Team Name: 

The Ultimate Champions

Team policies:
          All medium-to-major design decisions must be unanimously passed.
          All git commits must be small(ish) and commit messages detailed.

          All code must be well documented (in case partner falls behind and other partner needs to                         complete the work).
 
Primary mode of communication: 

Google hangouts (the chatbox @ the side of the gmail page). 
It's integrated w gmail so we can check osu email and latest group developments @ the same time.

How long do members have to respond to communication? (e.g. once you receive a message from my teammate, how soon are you obligated to send one back with your reply?)     

Instantly; reply as soon as message is seen (even if ur busy just say "k, but soon..").
 

What should a team member do if they...?
 Get confused about what to do:   

1. Post in Hangouts detaining problem (so partner is aware of problem and can investigate)   

2. Ask in office hours (if session in progress)   

3. Scour Piazza for similar question. If not found, post confusion. 

Fall behind in their work: 

Tell partner (hangouts) right away and discuss how to proceed.

Partner will continue to complete their assigned section first. Then, move on to other partner's parts if needed until other partner is caught up and can continue working.

Think they will fall behind due to upcoming exigent circumstances, etc:   

Tell partner (hangouts) and ask instructor how to proceed.

Fail to contribute sufficiently to an assignment (e.g. should they do extra work on the next one?)   

Student will consider dropping their least important course to work more on this one.
