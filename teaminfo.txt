1. Your team members’ names and roles (these may change later and that's fine). Indicate who is the team leader, if applicable.
e.g.

       Joe Coderman, Researcher and Submission Proofreader;
       Cindy Softwarewolf, Team Leader and Deadline Enforcer
       Asa Dataminer, Creativity Officer and Piazza liaison
2. Your team’s name
3. Your team’s policies:

What will be the team’s primary mode of communication? (e.g. Teams, Slack, Discord, email, text, messenger owl)
How long do members have to respond to communication? (e.g. once you receive a message from my teammate, how soon are you obligated to send one back with your reply?)
What should a team member do if they...?
Get confused about what to do
Fall behind in their work
Think they will fall behind due to upcoming exigent circumstances, etc.
Fail to contribute sufficiently to an assignment (e.g. should they do extra work on the next one?)
There is no one right set of policies; you should come up with a contract that you all feel is equitable and which you can actually keep. Refer to the group contract throughout the term and revise if necessary.
